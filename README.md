# JoJo-Calculator
## The best calculator ever, just because it's JoJo on background.
Of course it's not the only reason.

## Benefits
✅ It's able to call a stand!<br>
✅ JS written with OOP principle<br>
✅ Free interface customization<br>
✅ Jotaro Kujo with Star Platinum<br>
✅ Robert Speedwagon with sexuality<br>

I did my best to write small and readable code with OOP, and used Sass with BEM to style an interface.

Enjoy!
